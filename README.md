# bash_history_improved
This is my configuration so that bash history actually works! Infinite number of line storage, test to see everything is set up correctly, does not occasionally delete back to 500 lines.

My system that this works on:
Linux 5.10.0-14-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.113-1 (2022-04-29) x86_64 GNU/Linux
